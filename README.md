# stripe82

These codes aims to combine the Jiang, Linhua's strip82 catalog into an R-band selected catalog by:

1, wget the catalog

2, convert the ascii catalog into fits

3, Combine the r-band selected catalog

Catalogs can be downloaded from http://das.sdss.org/ge/sample/stripe82/sdss/

The details of the data are described in Jiang et al. 2014, ApJS.

I would like to write a code to return the wget comands for the input ra dec after Nov. 2016 if necessary.
